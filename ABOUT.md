# Tree Of Life

## What is the Tree Of Life app?

Our aim is to educate people on the importance of sustainability through a fun and interactive mobile game called 'Tree of Life '.  This game would enable users to learn about the cycle of life and embrace sustainable habits like planting trees which are a vital link to sustainability and climate change. The app was produced by 4 women, as part of the November 2021 All-Women Global Virtual Hackathon hosted by The Expat Woman under the theme of *Social Impact*.

## The Challenge

Modern burial methods such as traditional coffins, caskets, and cremation are actively leaching toxic chemicals into our soil, causing harm to our bodies and ecosystem and prevents us from experiencing the full cycle of life.

## The Solution

Through educating and engaging users with the Tree of Life game, our goal is to provide effective and greener alternatives to cater to the passing of the physical body and other sustainable habits that combat climate change via a series of fun interactive games. 

The app leverages existing portable devices such as mobile phones and tablets, with a promising future of also utilizing GPS (Global Positioning System) to integrate Augmented and Virtual Reality interactive games. 

Whether the user is indoors or out, the app encourages users to re-embrace nature by prompting users to go outside in search of incentivized activities such as treasure hunting. Users can earn rewards with the crucial importance of learning about sustainability via treasure found nuggets of information. Participating in real impactful activities for the good of our planet increases the user's "Feel Good" feelings, giving them a strong sense of achievement. 

Also, user empowerment through learning and accomplishing tasks is further elevated with features of personal avatar customization, with a vital option to access a pool of like-minded individuals who have an interest in the game and importantly its ultimate goal of fighting the climate crisis. 

The social impact ultimately exceeds newfound friendships and connections and will bring together a mass of unity to fight climate change and increase sustainable living for generations to come.
