### Email Configuration

To send out emails from our email to users that sign-up, we will need to input our email and password into the [question.py](./question.py) file. Inside the `SignUp` class, the `s_user` and `s_pass` should be set to your email and password.


```python
s_user = "my-email-address@myemail.com"
s_pass = "SomePASSWORD123!"
```
